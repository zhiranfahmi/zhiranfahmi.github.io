Michael Ehrmantraut is a fictional character in Breaking Bad and its spinoff prequel Better Call Saul,
played by Jonathan Banks. Mike is a former Philadelphia police officer who works for Gus Fring—and, on occasion, Saul Goodman—as a private investigator, head of security, cleaner, and hitman.
His reasons for leaving the force in Philadelphia are never specified during the Breaking Bad series, but are detailed in Better Call Saul. In 2019, he briefly appeared in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,
a film directed and written by Vince Gilligan, made by Netflix and a continuation of the original series. In 2019, he became the first character to appear in Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul,
and El Camino and is one of only two characters to have appeared in all three, the other being Ed Galbraith.
