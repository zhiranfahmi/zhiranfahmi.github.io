Jesse Bruce Pinkman is a fictional character in the television series Breaking Bad, played by Aaron Paul. He is a crystal meth cook and dealer, and works with his former high school chemistry teacher,
Walter White (Bryan Cranston) in a meth operation. Jesse is the only character besides Walt to appear in every episode of the show. Paul reprised the role for the 2019 spin-off film El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,
a sequel to the series set after the events of the show's series finale.
Despite plans to kill off the character at the end of the first season, Paul's performance convinced showrunner and head writer Vince Gilligan to keep Jesse in the show.
The character and Paul's performance have received acclaim from critics and fans. Critics especially praised Jesse's character development from an unsympathetic drug dealer to the
moral compass of the show as he becomes increasingly guilty and remorseful for his and Walter White's actions while involved in the drug trade. For his portrayal, Paul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor
in a Drama Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014â€”which makes him one of two actors to win the category three times since its separation into drama and comedy, along with Peter Dinklage.
